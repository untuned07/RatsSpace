                        Earth is our home planet. It is the third planet from the Sun and the only planet in the solar system that harbours life. It is home to all known life in the universe. The presence of water on the planet helps to support life. It has a diameter of about 12,682 km at the equator and 12,640 km at the poles. The planet moves around the Sun in about 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9.54 seconds. The length of a day on Earth is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes.

                        The Earth is composed of various layers. The interior of the Earth is divided into four layers the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The crust is the outermost layer and the mantle lies just below the crust. The innermost part is the core. The core is divided into the inner and outer core. The inner core is a solid metal core. It is made up of nickel and iron. It has a diameter of about 1,193.6 km. The outer core is a liquid molten core composed of nickel and iron. The mantle is made of dense and mostly solid silicate rock and the crust is a thin silicate rock material.

                    <div class="contentPage">
                        Earth is covered by a thin atmosphere composed of nitrogen (78 per cent), oxygen (21 per cent), and other gases (1 per cent). The atmosphere is divided into four layers, troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and ionosphere. The atmosphere scatters blue light around and fills the sky with the colour blue. This makes our planet appear blue when seen from space. The atmosphere does not have an outer limit. It gradually fades into space.

                        The Earth is the only planet that has an abundance of liquid water on its surface. Almost 70 per cent of the planet is covered with water. But only a small portion of the water is suitable for drinking. About 97 per cent of the water found on Earth is salty water. Much of the fresh water is frozen in the polar ice caps.

                        The shape of the Earth is not a perfect sphere. It is called a geoid. The planet is flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. The accurate shape can be determined by tracking the orbit of the satellites.
