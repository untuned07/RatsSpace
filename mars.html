                        Mars, the red planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is the second-smallest planet in the solar system with a diameter of about 6794.650 km. The planet takes around 687 Earth days to complete one revolution around the Sun. The length of a day on Mars is 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds. Mars is a terrestrial planet like Earth, Mercury, and Venus. It is made up of three layers, the core, mantle, and crust.

                        Mars has a cratered surface. It is covered with fine-grained reddish dust. The surface in the southern hemisphere is old and heavily cratered. It resembles the surface of Earth's Moon. The northern hemisphere has few craters and the surface has been smoothened by repeated lava flows from several volcanoes that erupted in this hemisphere.

                        Mars has a thin atmosphere. It is mainly composed of carbon dioxide (95.3 per cent). Nitrogen, argon, carbon monoxide, water vapour, and a small amount of oxygen are also found. Mars too has seasonal changes like our Earth. But given its distance from the Sun, Mars is quite cold. Temperatures rarely rise above the freezing point during a mid- summer's day and the surface remains frozen throughout the year. The North Pole is seasonally covered with carbon dioxide ice caps. The planet also experiences huge dust storms that blow across it.

                        Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They were discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877. Phobos is larger than Deimos. Both the moons have a heavily cratered surface. They are covered with dust and loose rocks. Phobos orbits Mars just about 6,000 km above its surface. It is the closest orbiting satellite. Deimos takes around 30 hours to complete one revolution around the planet while Phobos revolves three times in a day.

                        Many space probes sent to Mars have gathered relevant information about the planet. Mariner 4, launched by the United States in 1964, performed the first successful flyby of the planet. Mariner 6 and 7 followed suit in 1969. The first probes to land on Mars were Viking 1 and Viking 2, launched in 1976. The probes analysed the chemical composition of the atmosphere and the terrain, and mapped the surface of the planet. In July 2003, NASA launched the twin robotic rovers Spirit and Opportunity to explore the planet. The rovers landed on Mars in January 2004. They are a part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project. The robots are searching for clues that will help scientists find out if Mars ever had wet environments and supported any life.
