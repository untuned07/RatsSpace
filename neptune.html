                        Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun. It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system. It has a diameter of about 49,240 km. The position of the planet was predicted for the first time by French mathematician Urbain Joseph Le Verrier. It was discovered by Johann Gottfried Galle in 1846. Neptune is the outermost gaseous giant. It has a rocky core surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere. Neptune takes around 16 hours and 7 minutes to complete a rotation on its axis. The planet takes 165 Earth years, that is, about 60,225 Earth days to revolve around the Sun.

                        The atmosphere of Neptune is made up principally of hydrogen (74 per cent) and helium (25 per cent), and methane (1 per cent). The presence of methane gives it a blue colour. The planet has striped clouds and is extremely windy. In fact, it is the windiest planet in the solar system. Winds blow at a speed of around 2,400 km/h. The planet also experiences great storms. Neptune has a Great Dark Spot similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.

                        Neptune has 13 known moons. Triton is the largest moon with a diameter of about 2,689.6 km. It is the coldest object in the solar system. It has a surface temperature of -270 Â°C. Unlike other moons, Triton rotates in the opposite direction to that of Neptune. The surface of Triton has several ice volcanoes. These volcanoes were observed by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's (NASA) Voyager 2 spacecraft. The other 12 moons of Neptune are Nereid, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Naiad, Proteus, Thalassa, Halimede, Psamathe, Sao, Laomedeia, and Neso. Nereid is the third largest moon of Neptune.

                        Neptune has six faint rings. These rings were discovered by NASA's Voyager 2 in 1989. The rings are of varying thickness and are made of rocks and dust. The outermost ring is Adams Ring. It has three distinct arcs. They are named Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Adams Ring is about 62,633.6 km from the centre of Neptune.

                        Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune. It was named after Gerard Kuiper who proposed its existence in 1951. The belt is a disk-shaped region of icy debris. It is at a distance of about 4.5-7.5 billion km from the Sun. Scientists believe that most comets originate in this belt.
