                        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. The planet is surrounded by seven thin, flat rings around the equator. The rings make it one of the most beautiful bodies of the solar system. The planet was observed for the first time in 1610 by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.

                        Saturn is the largest planet after Jupiter and has a diameter of about 1,20,536 km. It is also one of the fastest planets. It completes one rotation in about 10 hours, 39 minutes and takes around 10,759 Earth days to complete one revolution around the Sun.

                        Saturn is a gaseous planet. It is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It also has ice of Sammonia, ice of methane, and water ice. The inner core of the planet is hot and solid. It is made up of iron and rocky material. The core is surrounded by the outer core, which is made up of ammonia, methane, and water. The outer core has a layer of thick liquid hydrogen and helium around it. Saturn is the least dense planet. Its specific gravity (the density of a solid or liquid relative to the maximum density of water) is less than water. Saturn is the most massive planet after Jupiter. It is 95 times as massive as Earth.

                        Saturn has 62 known moons. The first moon to be discovered was Titan. It was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in the year 1655. Jean-Dominique Cassini discovered the next four, Iapetus, Rhea Dione, and Mimas between 1671 and 1684. Titan is the largest of all the Saturn moons and the second largest moon in the solar system. It has a diameter of about 5,120 km. Titan is the only moon in the solar system that has a planet-like atmosphere. The atmosphere is composed of thick nitrogen and extends almost 592 km into space (Earth's atmosphere extends just 59.2 km into space). Most of the other moons of Saturn are highly cratered. For example, the moon Mimas has a crater that covers almost one-third of its diameter.

                        The rings of Saturn were discovered by Galileo in 1610. The rings consist of thousands of narrow ringlets made up of billions of pieces of ice and rock. They orbit the planet at different velocities. Rings C, B, and A are the major rings. They are extremely wide. Their width extends to around 3,97,676.8 km from the planet's surface. Rings B and A are divided by the Cassini division-a gap that measures around 4,672 km. Rings D, F, G, and E are the fainter rings.
