                        Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Like most of the objects in the solar system, the moon too was formed about 4.6 billion years ago. Its average radius is about 27 per cent of Earth's radius. The moon is at a distance of about 3,82,168 km from the Earth. It takes around 29½ days to complete one rotation on its axis and takes around 231/3days to complete one revolution around the Earth. The moon has no atmosphere.

                        The great Italian astronomer, Galileo Galilei, was the first to study and map the moon's surface in 1609. Galileo used a telescope to make his observations. He found that the moon had hills and plains. Over the years, scientists and astronauts, who have studied and explored the moon, have found that the satellite has a highly cratered surface. Most of the craters were formed by the impact of meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. It has shallow depressions called basins, and broad flat plains known as maria. The surface of the moon is covered with a powdery dust called regolith

                        The creation of the moon is based on four main theories but only one of them gives the actual description of the creation. The first theory states that the moon was created by the combination of dust and gas during the formation of the solar system. According to the second theory, the moon is an asteroid that was captured by Earth's gravity. The third theory states that at the time of the formation of Earth, the spinning motion of a primordial accretion disc split into two forming the Earth and the moon. The fourth and the popular theory states that a Mars-sized planet crashed into Earth with great speed and almost destroyed it. All the rock and debris in the orbit finally coalesced and created the moon.

                        The moon appears to change its shape as it orbits the Earth. The different shapes are known as the phases of the moon. The moon goes through four phases in one lunar day or 29½ Earth days. The four phases of the moon are new moon, first quarter, full moon, and the last quarter.

                        Tides are the regular rising and falling of the ocean's surface. They are primarily caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and Sun. The moon's gravity pulls at the Earth causing the oceans to bulge out in the direction of the moon. The oceans at the opposite side of the Earth also bulge out due to centrifugal effects. This pull and its effect cause two tides per day on the Earth's centrifugal oceans. The English scientist, Sir Isaac Newton, was the first to explain tides.

                        The first visit to the moon was made by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 1 in 1959. It escaped the gravity of earth and passed near the moon. In the same year, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 2 made its impact on the surface of the moon. The Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 then took the first photographs of the far side of the moon. In 1966, Luna 9 made the first successful lunar soft landing and Luna 10 was the first unmanned vehicle to orbit the moon. The Apollo 11 lunar module of the United States was the first spacecraft to land people successfully on the moon in 1969. Neil Armstrong, the commander of the mission became the first man to set foot on the moon. After the Apollo 11, the United States sent six more Apollo missions. Apollo 17 was the last among them. It landed on the moon in December 1972.
