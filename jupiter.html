                        Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system. It has a diameter of about 1,42,153.6 km, which is about 11 times that of the Earth's diameter. The planet is about 300 times more massive than Earth. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is around 7,74,04,954 km away from it. The planet takes about 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun and completes one rotation in about 10 hours.

                        The Great Red Spot is a giant spinning storm on Jupiter that resembles a hurricane. It is brick-red to light brown in colour and is seen around 22Â° south of its equator. The storm circulates at a speed of 358.4 km/h on the edges. It is about 13,918 km wide and 27,840 km long. The spot has been observed by astronomers for more than 300 years.

                        Jupiter is a giant ball of gas with little or no surface. Its atmosphere is mostly made up of molecular hydrogen (87 per cent) and helium (14 per cent). Other substances present are methane, ammonia, and phosphine. Most of the visible cloud is made up of ammonia. Water also exists on the planet. The dark belts and light zones of the planet are formed by the strong winds that blow in the upper atmosphere of the planet.

                        Jupiter has 62 known moons. The four largest moons-Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto were discovered by Galileo Galilei in the year 1610. Galileo discovered the moons using his primitive telescope and described his discovery in his book Sidereus Nuncius for the first time. These four moons are known as Galilean moons now. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system with a diameter of 5,232 km. It is mostly made up of ice and rocky material. Io, the third largest moon of Jupiter, is the most volcanically active object in the solar system. Europa has a surface covered with ice while Callisto has a heavily cratered surface.

                        Jupiter has one single ring. It is made up mostly of dust particles that are less than 10 microns in diameter. The ring is divided into three major components the main ring, the halo, and the faint gossamer ring. The main ring is about 6,960 km wide and the halo is about 19,883 km thick.
